# Multisite URL Fixer

A WordPress plugin to fix admin links due to the Bedrock url changes. See [this issue](https://github.com/roots/bedrock/issues/250) for more background.

_Note: This plugin does not effect the paths for other stylesheets or plugins, just the URLs for sites using Bedrock, specifically to fix broken links with the /wp/ that Bedrock adds *within the admin* due to WordPress being installed in a subfolder._

Many thanks to [@felixarntz](https://github.com/felixarntz) for the original code!
